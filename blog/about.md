# About Java for Scala Developers

This blog is a practical guide for Scala developers who need to work with Java again. Whether you're transitioning to a Java project, working in a polyglot environment, or just curious about modern Java, this guide is for you.

## Why This Guide?

Many Scala developers started with Java and then moved to Scala for its functional programming features, type inference, and concise syntax. However, Java has evolved significantly, especially with recent releases (Java 17, 21, and beyond).

This guide helps you:

- **Understand modern Java features** - Records, sealed classes, pattern matching, virtual threads
- **Compare with Scala** - See how Java's new features relate to what you already know
- **Practical examples** - Real code examples you can run and experiment with

## About the Author

I'm a software developer who has worked extensively with both Scala and Java. I created this guide to help others navigate the transition between these two JVM languages.
