/*
 * Blog module build configuration.
 *
 * This module contains the Jekyll-based GitHub Pages blog. While it's part of
 * the Gradle multi-module project structure, the actual build is handled by
 * Jekyll/Bundler (not Gradle). This build.gradle serves to:
 *
 * 1. Include the blog as a recognized Gradle subproject
 * 2. Allow running './gradlew build' from the root without errors
 * 3. Maintain consistency in the multi-module project structure
 *
 * To build the blog locally:
 *   cd blog && bundle install && bundle exec jekyll serve
 *
 * The CI/CD workflow uses Jekyll directly for the actual blog build.
