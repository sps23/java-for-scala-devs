# CodeQL Security Analysis
#
# This workflow runs CodeQL analysis on the repository.
#
# Note on Scala Support:
# CodeQL does not natively support Scala source code analysis. However, since
# Scala compiles to JVM bytecode, CodeQL's java-kotlin analyzer can analyze
# the compiled bytecode and detect some security issues. This provides partial
# coverage for Scala code.
#
# For more comprehensive Scala-specific analysis, consider using additional
# tools like Scalastyle, Scapegoat, or WartRemover.
