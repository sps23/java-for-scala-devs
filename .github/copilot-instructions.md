# Copilot Instructions

This repository is a practical guide for Scala developers who want to write Java code. It provides comparisons, examples, and best practices for transitioning between the two JVM languages.

## Project Overview

- **Purpose**: Educational content comparing Java and Scala approaches
- **Target audience**: Scala developers learning Java
- **Content type**: Documentation, code examples, and tutorials

## Code Standards

### Java Code Guidelines

- Follow standard Java naming conventions (camelCase for variables/methods, PascalCase for classes)
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Prefer immutability where practical
- Write clear JavaDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep methods focused and concise

### Scala Code Guidelines

- Follow standard Scala style conventions
- Use idiomatic Scala patterns
- Prefer functional approaches where appropriate

## Development Flow

When adding new content:

1. Ensure code examples are clear and well-commented
2. Include both Java and Scala versions when comparing concepts
3. Explain the differences and trade-offs between approaches
4. Test all code examples to ensure they compile and run correctly

## Key Guidelines

1. Write clear, beginner-friendly explanations
2. Include practical, runnable code examples
3. Highlight key differences between Java and Scala idioms
4. Maintain consistency in formatting and structure
